//Question: We have received two JS object from an API, but we need one merged object.
//You need to write a function to merge the data
//If any keys have conflicting values, they should be concatenated with " / "
//between each value. There should be no missing data. Try to write your function to support any variations of data, or multiple sources.

/* Thought Process
seeing the example objects given. the simple solution would of been to get the names of each value and add convert each value to a string to concat.
However, doing so wouldnt let this function be expandable to other objects that dont follow the same naming conventions. What if there was an object with an extra Array?
Because of that I've made this function longer. Based on for loop recursion, this function will take any amount of objects and not only meet the requirements of the test,
but also concat values that are not present in all of the objects as well as attach unique values to the resulting object.

the function needs to be fed an Array element in order
